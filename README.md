Hello! 
I'm WhosWho, an intermediate-level programmer that can code in C++ for now.
This is my first time uploading something to git and making a project like this, so I hope you can spare me haha
Anyway, I hope you'll enjoy this project from the show! I know it'd have been more fun to have 4 other players just like in the show, though it would take much more effort to implement that for now with the knowledge I currently possess. 
As a result, there is only one player (the bot).
Maybe in the future I will change this and make it so that you can play against 4 other bots 
Let me know if you have any code improvements suggestions or bugs to report!
