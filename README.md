Hello! 
I'm WhosWho, an intermediate-level programmer that can code in C++ for now.
This is my first time uploading something to github and making a project like this, so I hope you can spare me haha
Anyway, I hope you'll enjoy this project from the show! I know it'd have been more fun to have 4 other players just like in the show, though it would take much more effort to implement that for now with the knowledge I currently possess. 
As a result, there is only one player (the bot).
Maybe in the future I will change this and make it so that you can play against 4 other bots 
Let me know if you have any code improvements suggestions or bugs to report!

This project was written in C++.
In order to run the program, run the file "main.cpp" after getting the other ones too, otherwise it won't work. Go to an online C++ compiler such as OnlineGDB (Link: https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler) and upload all the files there or you can just use Code::Blocks (where I wrote the program), Visual Studio Code and others like that and upload all the files there.
